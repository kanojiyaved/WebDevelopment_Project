# WebDevelopment_Project

A fully responsive website created using HTML and basic CSS is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal viewing experience. The layout automatically adjusts for desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, ensuring that content remains accessible and visually appealing across all platforms.

Key Features:

Media Queries: CSS media queries are employed to apply different styles for various screen sizes, ensuring that the design remains flexible and user-friendly.

Flexible Images: Images are set to scale within their containers to avoid overflowing or distortion on smaller screens.

Simple Navigation: The navigation menu adapts to different devices, often transforming into a hamburger menu on mobile screens.

Accessible Design: Text, buttons, and input elements are resized or repositioned to be easily accessible on touch devices and different resolutions.

This approach to web design ensures the website looks and works well across a wide range of devices without the need for complex frameworks.
